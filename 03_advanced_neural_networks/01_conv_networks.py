# # Convolutional Neural Networks
# 
# Up until transformers, convolutions were *the* state of the art in computer vision.  In many ways and applications they still are!
# 
# Large Language Models, which are what we'll focus on the rest of the series after this lecture, are really good at ordered, *tokenized data.  But there is lots of data that isn't _implicitly_ ordered like `images`, and their more general cousins `graphs`.
# 
# Today's lecture focuses on computer vision models, and particularly on convolutional neural networks.  There are a ton of applications you can do with these, and not nearly enough time to get into them.  Check out the extra references file to see some publications to get you started if you want to learn more.

# # Convolutional Building Blocks
# 
# We're going to go through some examples of building blocks for convolutional networks.  To help illustate some of these, let's use an image for examples:
# 

# %%
from PIL import Image
alcf_image = Image.open("ALCF-Staff.jpg")

# %%
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
figure = plt.figure(figsize=(20,20))
plt.imshow(alcf_image)

# ## Convolutions
# 
# Convolutions are a restriction of - and a specialization of - dense linear layers.  A convolution of an image produces another image, and each output pixel is a function of only it's local neighborhood of points.  This is called an _inductive bias_ and is a big reason why convolutions work for image data: neighboring pixels are correlated and you can operate on just those pixels at a time.
# 
# See examples of convolutions [here](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic)

alcf_tensor = torchvision.transforms.ToTensor()(alcf_image)

# Reshape the tensor to have a batch size of 1:
alcf_tensor = alcf_tensor.reshape((1,) + alcf_tensor.shape)

# Create a random convolution:
# shape is: (channels_in, channels_out, kernel_x, kernel_y)
conv_random = torch.rand((3,3,15,15))

# ## Normalization
# 
# ![Batch Norm](batch_norm.png)
# Reference: [Normalizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10520.pdf)
# 
# Normalization is the act of transforming the mean and moment of your data to standard values (usually 0.0 and 1.0).  It's particularly useful in machine learning since it stabilizes training, and allows higher learning rates.

# ## Downsampling (And upsampling)
# 
# Downsampling is a critical component of convolutional and many vision models.  Because of the local-only nature of convolutional filters, learning large-range features can be too slow for convergence.  Downsampling of layers can bring information from far away closer, effectively changing what it means to be "local" as the input to a convolution.

# ## Residual Connections
# 
# One issue, quickly encountered when making convolutional networks deeper and deeper, is the "Vanishing Gradients" problem.  As layers were stacked on top of each other, the size of updates dimished at the earlier layers of a convolutional network.  The paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" solved this by introduction "residual connections" as skip layers.

# # Building a ConvNet
# 
# In this section we'll build and apply a conv net to the mnist dataset.  The layers here are loosely based off of the ConvNext architecture.  Why?  Because we're getting into LLM's soon, and this ConvNet uses LLM features.  ConvNext is an update to the ResNet architecture that outperforms it.

# # Homework 1:
# 
# In this notebook, we've learned about some basic convolutional networks and trained one on CIFAR-10 images.  It did ... OK.  There is significant overfitting of this model.  There are some ways to address that, but we didn't have time to get into that in this session.
# 
# Meanwhile, your homework (part 1) for this week is to try to train the model again but with a different architecture.  Change one or more of the following:
# - The number of convolutions between downsampling
# - The number of filters in each layer
# - The initial "patchify" layer
# - Another hyper-parameter of your choosing
# 
# 
# And compare your final validation accuracy to the accuracy shown here.  Can you beat the validation accuracy shown?
# 
# For full credit on the homework, you need to show (via text, or make a plot) the training and validation data sets' performance (loss and accuracy) for all the epochs you train.  You also need to explain, in several sentences, what you changed in the network and why you think it makes a difference.
